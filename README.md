# Titanic
Response to the Titanic challenge on Kaggle.

In an attempt to make files more concise, I'm changing the format. Instead of having a large file doing everything, I'm breaking this down into manageble bits focussing on one aspect - EDA, data manipulation, and then the individual models - at a time. The ultimate goal is to use these files as a customized module.

Will update this Readme as I go along.
